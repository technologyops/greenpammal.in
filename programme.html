The sanitary inspector of the municipality will take stock of the vehicles, drums and other items and certify the same on a monthly basis.
The municipal administration should aim for a garbage free municipality by 31.8.2006 so that all dust bins should be removed and the municipality should be a 'dust bin-free' one.
</li><br />
		<li style="font-size:14px; font-weight:bold; color:#7c9641;"> The support provided by the municipality for the activity includes:</li>
        <li style="list-style:disc; list-style-position:inside;">Tricycles - 70 </li>

        <li style="font-size:14px; font-weight:bold; color:#7c9641;">The Biogas Project</li>
        <li>In order to demonstrate the concept of waste recycling and better utilization of municipal solid waste management a pilot waste to energy plant has been installed with indigenous  technology and machinery supplied by a Kerala entrepreneur. The technology adopted is a low cost biomethanisation technology which is eco friendly and sustainable.  Biogas is being generated from kitchen waste which in turn is converted to electricity using a 100% biogas engine which is sufficient to light up 50 street lights. The slurry which is generated after biomethanisation is a useful end product which is being used as good source of organic manure. Electrical energy produced is clean and green energy which can complement the conventional energy thereby reducing pollution. The excess biogas produced is being used as a clean fuel in the canteen and it is replacing LPG. Such initiatives of EGP will help many institutions to scale up and this is being modeled as a business /entrepreneur unit which can be easily replicated. The strength of this project is the ease with which it can be replicated and can be managed with very limited manpower and with little or no maintenance involved. <br />
Decomposing garbage in dumpsites is estimated to produce a third of India’s climate changing methane gas. By collecting kitchen waste and processing it in a Biogas digester, we capture gas that would otherwise warm the climate.<br />
Exnora Green Pammal’s initiative can bring about effective partnership between the Foundation and several institutions like the Commercial Canteens, Big Hotels, Hostels, Eating Houses, etc where waste disposal is not only a problem but a nuisance too.  The Biogas facility was inaugurated in September 2010 and was well attended and received wide media coverage.</li><br />

		<li style="font-size:14px; font-weight:bold; color:#7c9641;">Panipat</li>
        <li style="font-size:14px;">EPNS members</li>
        <li>Located approximately 90 km north of New Delhi, Panipat has a population of approximately 3,00,000. Panipat is a major producer of textiles, with exports worth 2,500 crore.</li><br />
        <li style="font-size:14px;">Background </li><br />
        <li>After seeing Exnora Green Pammal's impact and performance in Pammal, PepsiCo asked Exnora to initiate similar services in Panipat, Haryana, where a PepsiCo plant is located. In May 2006, PepsiCo invited Exnora International's founder, Mr. M. B. Nirmal, to Panipat to discuss introducing services there. In November 2006, Ms. Mangalam Balasubramanian visited Panipat and held more detailed discussions with officials, residents and representatives of PepsiCo. She found that the district administration and the Panipat municipal engineer were eager to initiate door-to-door waste collection.<br /><br />

Although waste management is a responsibility of the Panipat municipality, many residents hired private waste collectors because collection by the understaffed municipality was irregular. Residents report that private collectors dumped domestic waste at intersections and in Panipat's neighborhood parks. Animals rummaged through the heaps of rubbish, and waste was scattered by wind, and often burned. According to the president of a residents' welfare association (RWA), Panipat's neighborhoods used to look very shabby.<br /><br />

In March 2007, Mr. N. K. Jindal, Panipat's municipal engineer, and a team of junior engineers visited Pammal to become familiar with the new system. Panipat has a network of RWAs, which maintain Panipat's neighborhood parks. To strengthen local ownership of the new, door-to-door waste management services, RWA leaders created an NGO, Exnora Panipat Navnirman Samiti (EPNS), which helps to administer services by educating residents, collecting user fees from the households and paying green ambassadors. In April 2007, EPNS signed a memorandum of understanding with EGP, formalizing their partnership.<br /><br />

An awareness campaign, involving rallies and public meetings in the parks, commenced in June 2007 to educate residents about door-to-door collection and source segregation of waste. Representatives from the RWAs, EGP, EPNS, PepsiCo and the municipal and district administrations participated actively in the campaign. Red and green wastebaskets were distributed to all homes and shops.<br /><br />

The municipality identified a three-acre site on the edge of town for construction of compost sheds and a dump yard. PepsiCo provided funds to lease the land and sponsored construction of the necessary buildings with 80 vermicomposting tanks. In town, the municipality allocated an office for the project management unit.<br /><br />

Services were launched in November 2007. Door-to-door waste collection has dramatically improved the cleanliness of participating neighborhoods, inspiring neighboring residents to invite EPNS to extend services to their areas. The number of homes covered has increased from 3,000 to 10,000 in two years.<br /><br />

Partnership Structure: Roles and Responsibilities Panipat Municipality – identified land for the compost sheds and dumpsite, allocated office space for the project management unit, laid the access road from the highway to the compost sheds and dumpsite, provides transport vehicles, push carts, tools and tackle, and red and green dust bins for every residence<br /><br />

PepsiCo – sponsors the project management unit, the awareness campaign, staff training and uniforms, operating costs, and a consultancy fee to EGP. PepsiCo also sponsored construction of the compost sheds, and pays the rent for land for the dumpsite and compost sheds.<br /><br />

EGP – provided technical assistance in setting up the SWM system in Panipat, trained EPNS, and provided professional guidance for management, training and shed construction.
<br /><br />
EPNS – collects user fees, pays green ambassadors and encourages residents to sort their waste<br /><br />

Residents – pay the prescribed monthly user fee of between Rs 20 and Rs 40 per house, according to income level, and segregate their waste. Shops pay Rs 50 per month. Small hospitals pay Rs 100 per month. Large hospitals pay Rs 200 per month, and schools pay Rs 500 per month.

        <li style="font-size:14px; font-weight:bold; color:#7c9641;">Department of Atomic Energy Townships: </li>
        <li style="font-size:14px; font-weight:bold;">Kalpakkam, Anupuram and Bhavini  </li><br />
        <li>The Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) townships of Kalpakkam, Anupuram and Bhavini have approximately 30,000 residents who work in atomic energy production and research facilities operated by the Indian government. The townships occupy 870 acres, approximately 60 kilometers south of Chennai.</li>
        <li style="font-size:14px;">Background </li>
        <li>Ms. Balasubramanian was invited by the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR) to initiate solid waste management in Kalpakkam, Anupuram and Bhavini after she delivered a lecture at Kalpakkam in 2006. Finalizing the contract and preparations took several months. Staff were recruited primarily from neighboring fishing communities.
<br /><br />
Previously, waste management services in the townships were contracted to private parties that collected waste from community bins and transported it to a dumpsite. According to residents, the previous services were performed irregularly, leaving neighborhoods very dirty.<br /><br />

Now the townships' waste is transported to Exnora Green Pammal's 3,000 square-foot vermicompost shed situated at Natham Kariacheri Village, eight km from Kalpakkam, and to a dumpsite leased by EGP. In addition to collecting waste from 6,000 residences, EGP also collects waste from six schools, six office buildings, three marriage halls, two hotels, 15 shops and tea stalls, and the bus stand. EGP is also responsible for keeping the entire open area of the townships free of litter.</li><br />
		
        <li style="font-size:15px;">Partnership Structure: Roles and Responsibilities</li>
        <li>EGP – responsible for all aspects of solid waste management in the townships. <br /><br />

The DAE townships – pay the fees according to a contract with EGP and monitor EGP's performance.<br /><br />

PepsiCo – provided a bank guarantee so that EGP could get an advance from the IGCAR to star.t</li><br />
		
        <li style="font-size:14px;">Residents – segregate their waste</li><br />
        
        <li style="font-size:14px; font-weight:bold; color:#7c9641;">Mangadu </li><br />
        <li>Mangadu town panchayat is famous for its large Kamatchi Amman temple, which is a pilgrimage destination. Mangadu is approximately 20 km from Chennai, near Poonamallee. The town's population is approximately 40,000</li>
        <li style="font-size:14px;">Background </li>
        <li id="filoo">In January 2009, Mr. Ravikumar, a resident of Pammal, was posted as the executive officer in Mangadu town panchayat. Impressed by the work of EGP around his own home in Pammal, Mr. Ravikumar invited EGP to manage solid waste in Mangadu. Meetings were held to work out a partnership between EGP and Mangadu town panchayat, <a href="http://www.greenpammal.in/peatable.html">tag heuer replica</a> and a resident awareness campaign commenced. <br /><br />

Collection services were launched in February 2009. Initially, door-to-door collection covered three wards. Coverage increased to seven wards by the end of 2009. The present EO of Mangadu, Mr. N. Ravi, expects that all 18 wards of the town will be covered by EGP by June 2010. <br /><br />

In Mangadu, the costs of waste management services are shared between the panchayat, residents and PepsiCo. Residents pay a monthly user fee of Rs 20 per house. The panchayat has used grants to construct a storage shed and a vermicomposting facility with 10 tanks. </li><br />
		<li style="font-size:14px;">Partnership Structure: Roles and Responsibilities </li>
        <li>EGP – provides labour, technical guidance, monitoring, shed maintenance and managerial staff <br /><br />

Mangadu Town Panchayat – provides tricycles, a truck, facilities, a pump for the compost shed, and an executive order for EEGP to operate<br /><br />

PepsiCo – contributed Rs 1,50,000 to support processing costs, the awareness campaign, supervisor's salary and monitoring<br /><br />

Residents – pay a monthly user fee of Rs 20 per house and segregate their waste</li><br />
		
        <li style="font-size:14px; font-weight:bold; color:#7c9641;">Cuddalore, Nagapattinam and Tenkasi </li>
        <li id="filoo">Shortly after the December 2004 Tsunami, the PepsiCo Foundation contacted EGP and asked how the Foundation could assist in the recovery of tsunami-affected communities. After discussing the options, it was decided that EGP and PepsiCo would replicate EGP's solid waste management model <a href="http://www.cheapperfectsale.com/patek-philippe-watches.html">patek philippe replica</a> in Cuddalore, Nagapattinam and Kanyakumari. However, difficulties encountered in Kanyakumari led us to shift that project to Tenkasi. <br /><br />

These projects operate in partnership with the Cuddalore, Nagapattinam and Tenkasi municipalities. In Cuddalore, the project is managed by Mr. R. M. Balasubramanian. In Nagapattinam, the project is managed by En. A. Rethinam. In Tenkasi, the project is managed by Dr. G. S. Vijaylakshmi.<br /><br />

Nagapattinam Project Cost Sharing by Partners: PepsiCo Foundation's sponsorship: project management unit cost, awareness, training and uniforms Municipality's sponsorship: from the MLA Fund Rs 1,00,000 Public (user payment): residents of 3 wards @ Rs 10 each from each household<br /><br />
