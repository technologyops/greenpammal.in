 for the most profitable Chinese companies, the appreciation of the renminbi is like the last straw to break the camel's back". 
 China should maintain the principle of "autonomy, controllability and gradual progress" of the RMB exchange rate, giving enterprises a certain amo <a href="http://www.jordanscomingout.com/air-jordan-11-space-jam-for-sale.html"><strong>air jordan 11 space jam for sale</strong></a> unt of time and space to adjust their export strategy and product mix, and change the mode of export growth. 
 pessimism pervades China's export companies. The latest data show that since 2008, China's export surplus has declined for third consecutive months, a combination of domestic and foreign factors gathered, the 2008 China's foreign trade industry has cast a huge shadow. 
 internal and external factors challenging China's foreign trade 
 in the April 15th opening of the 103rd session of the Canton Fair Chinese, Minister of Commerce Chen Deming analyzes the four main factors influencing Chinese foreign trade: the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis caused a negative impact on the markets of developed countries and consumer confidence; the international market prices of raw materials increase; the RMB exchange rate changes since last year; the relevant de <a href="http://www.alinktome.com/?p=275"><strong>cheap foamposites</strong></a> partments to implement a series of macro-control measures, such as the reduction of export tax rebates etc.. After the combination of many factors, it has an impact on the export of enterprises." 
 April 1st, CLSA issued the China purchasing managers' index (PMI) in March. The PMI index aims to reflect the health of the manufacturing sector. It is the international leading indicator system for macroeconomic monitoring. PMI is higher than 50, indicating that the manufacturing sector is expanding and, conversely, manufacturing is shrinking. The worry is that China's export orders index, which makes up 30% of the PMI, has fallen for the two month in a row, only 50.9, the lowest level in 14 months. This means that demand for export orders has continued to decline, and analysis shows that such exports are likely to remain volatile. 
 on April 30th, the Minis <a href="http://www.wedownjackets.com/buy-cheap-jordans-online/index.htm"><strong>buy cheap jordans online</strong></a> try of Commerce issued the report on China's foreign trade form in spring. The report pointed out that China's foreign trade is facing a tight environment at home and abroad, uncertain factors are further increased. China faces three major uncertainties. The slowdown in the world economy and trade growth is the biggest uncertainty facing China's export situation. The impact of the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States is developing to the real economy, such as consumption and investment. In 2007, the European Union, the United States and Japan were China's largest trading partners. Of these, the United States accounts for 17.5% of China's direct exports. From the perspective of the world trade structure, if the American economy falls into recession, then the economy of the European Union and Japan will be affected to varying degrees. 
 at the sa <a href="http://www.jordanscomingout.com/"><strong>cheap air jordans</strong></a> me time, the international market of primary products continued to rise, as a manufacturing and trading power, Chinese become the main undertaker of rising raw materials, export enterprises profit margins being squeezed, the decline in profitability, operating pressure increased.
