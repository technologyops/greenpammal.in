However, after October, whether the EU will adjust the anti-dumping duty can make nothing of it also did not last year, the final agreement.

 shoe fair prices also reflect on the EU's shoe orders than before tax decreased by about 20%, anti-dumping tax China leather shoes also increased by at least 10% in the EU price.
