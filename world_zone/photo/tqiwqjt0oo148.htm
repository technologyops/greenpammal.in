related information:, after an earlier sale of five pairs of HU  and NMD shoes, Pharrell seems to be busy with other things, stopping the pace of exposing new shoes for us. However, recently, the news came online, but also a new pair of Hu NMD "Noble Crimson"   color will be released next year. Believe that when you see it, the first response is "isn't that the" family limited "version?" Indeed, from the picture, and it is not commercially available earlier "friends limited edition", similar to the red color, but the upper big "family" and "friends" has become a common embroidery words "HUMAN RACE", do not know this change, will not affect your love for it?

That means that if you??re someone (mens sizes) who was unable to cop these back in 2001 and wear a smaller shoe size, then in 2015 you might have a chance to fit your foot into the newly released Air Jordan 11 Retro Low GS ??Citrus?? colorway.
