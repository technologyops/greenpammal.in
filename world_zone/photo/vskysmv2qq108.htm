Outside guess, in the end is which three teams Nov. 5 issue of "World Sports Daily" announced? Answer: Real Madrid, Chelsea and Bayern Munich. Faced with three giants invite sponsored by Adidas, the Macy's answer is NO! 
 
 Messi Adidas spokesperson, but Barcelona's shirt sponsor, but it is another sporting goods giant Nike, whenever Messi goal, he kissed the Barcelona team logo, Nike logo quite eye-catching. Adidas obviously does not like such a situation, the best solution is: Messi wearing the shirt sponsor Adidas, Adidas boots with a goal, this is the picture of harmony and unity, will help to promote the brand. 
 Adidas hopes Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Chelsea transfer operation of Messi, fleas and Barcelona liquidated damages of up to 250 million euros, three giants are sold the world's first transfer fe <a href="http://www.jordanscomingout.com/air-jordan-11-space-jam-for-sale.html"><strong>air jordan 11 space jam for sale</strong></a> e of 250 million euros. Among these, Adidas help invested 125 million.

"World Sports Daily" confirmed that ? 250 million offer does exist, the relevant documents are handed over to the Barcelona director of football Raul - Sanglie Yi. 
 For Real Madrid, Chelsea, Bayern, Adidas conditions out really attractive. In Madrid, for example, Adidas annual sponsorship fee of up to 40 million euros, Partnership to 2019-2020 season, If you get Messi, Adidas sponsorship fee to Real Madrid 56 million euros / year. Real Madrid and Adidas as well as seven-year contract extension, every year more than 16 million sponsorship fee, seven years is 112 million, plus the Adidas invested 125 million euros, equivalent to Real Madrid to buy Macy, Adidas pay. Chelsea could get each year from 35.5 million euros Adidas sponsorship fees, as Bayern Munich, the Bundesliga giants Adidas has a 9.4% stake.
