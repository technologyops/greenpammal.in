Although the official did not specify the Nike target opponent is Ultra Boost, but the two major brands of blows, is not difficult to make people think of the above views, even we notice yesterday also the readers "clever" pointed out this point. 
  

  The 
NOWRE team also participated in the Shanghai area of the conference this evening, surprise Nike running shoe design director TaeYong Lee to visit the site to you personally introduced this pair of new LunarEpic Flyknit. Although from the previous notice, we predict that this new model will use Flyknit woven fabric and Lunarlon technology at the end, but the shock of seeing objects i <a href="http://www.jordanscomingout.com/air-jordan-11-space-jam-for-sale.html"><strong>air jordan 11 space jam for sale</strong></a> s still strong.

Secondly, a chip of the Flyknit upper with knitting method in different parts of different density, fit and comfort degree of the foot as in the past good, join the Flywire fly line provides "socks" type of shoes, the lack of support. 
  
 friends may ask, this pair of LunarEpic Flyknit will be a storm "Lv Bu" Mercurial Superfly successor? Frankly to say, this pair of new positioning and Superfly this is not the same, are of little significance, LunarEpic Flyknit is more focused on running, of course, I believe that in the near fashion week will see this pair of new fashion friends of good control, and we'll talk. From the point of view, LunarEpic Flykn <a href="http://www.jordanscomingout.com/"><strong>cheap air jordans</strong></a> it will be reminiscent of early in the Free after seeing the kind of Flyknit 5, has the appearance of a trace of spirit, the same Flyknit and Flywire technology to build a low shoe uppers, just turned into help.
