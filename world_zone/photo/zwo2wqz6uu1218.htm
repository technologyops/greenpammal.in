A few years ago, when NIKE released the Ueno Air Force 1 and the Ueno Court Force High, the cherry blossom pattern was used in the design, and now the cherry blossoms are in full bloom again.

Each pair of shoes, including the root of the shoe and the middle part of the shoe, is printed with flowers and cherry blossoms. The pair of sneakers will be on sale later this year, so stay tuned for NBA's exciting follow-up reports. Source: Battle shoes Wang
