Because the world's first dynamic PUMA adequate science and technology. 
 PUMA MOBIUM ELITE is available with a retractable foot movement and sports shoes. Its design is derived from bionics and imitating nature. PUMA physiological mobility characte <a href="http://www.alinktome.com/?p=450" title="Cheap jordans online air jordan 11 blackout for sale"><strong>Cheap jordans online air jordan 11 blackout for sale</strong></a> ristics of the product for the foot for as long as two years of design and development, innovation and technology to make the soles of the feet can be scaled along the horizontal, vertical and longitudinal three dimensions, which can be coordinated with the overall movement, and arch significantly more natural and more efficient. 
 
When  PUMA Global Strategy and Innovation Director Luis ? Joseph (Louis Joseph) talking to PUMA MOBIUM design embodied technological innovation, he said: "Every innovation and technology PUMA is always to improve athletes' own experiences as a starting point to encourage aggressive and adventurous idea .MOBIUM ELITE is PUMA actual performance and endless imagination created by the combination of a new running shoes, but also a movement to change with the human dynamics adequate products, by virtue of which the style design concept has become a dynamic adequate product family run first flagship models. As with the cycle can change the shape of the foot and gait and <a href="http://www.jordanscomingout.com/air-jordan-11-space-jam-for-sale.html"><strong>air jordan 11 space jam for sale</strong></a>  stretch the concept of the first generation product, MOBIUM ELITE advent will break the static design of logo The traditional concept of running shoes. It combines a variety of science and technology in one, where many technology patent pending. In this regard we are always full of longing, and firmly believe that science and technology have adequate dynamic transformational breakthrough in the field of traditional jogging. "PUMA MOBIUM ELITE through the soles MOBIUM BAND to strengthen leg jumping ability to "figure 8" through the soles of the design of the sole in the running as motivated as the Achilles tendon. The greater the force applied, the greater the rebound. 
 The WINDLASS CHASSIS designed to mimic the arch of the foot winch mechanism of expansion and contraction when on the move. This man-made arch in arch motion to create a platform to help arch complete conversion of the gait in the entire running action.

 stride efficiency is a core value lies functional shoes, PUMA designers inspired by the planet's most efficient "running machine": leopard. Together with the expansion and contraction of leopard claws can shrink when standing forward and expand to provide a cushion, and this is similar, PUMA MOBIUM ELITE shoe outsole EXPANSION PODS can follow foot movements. Therefore, PUMA MOBIUM has shock absorption, protection and flexibility can make the runner's stride more efficient, more stable pace of conversion. 
Three innovative technology  PUMA MOBIUM ELITE allows runners can arch forward, rather than a heavy heel, making it the largest kinetic energy release and reduce foot the impact of rapid fall.

Taylor (Mary Taylor) said, "by the number of breakthrough technologies, we have created a new The field of sports shoes. Currently, static shoes is the mainstream of the market, the static shoes will not change with the movement of the foot. By design, we make MOBIUM ElITE dynamic adequate technology can stretch with foot movement through another .PUMA performance point of view, through genuine innovation to break with tradition, thus, MOBIUM born, and we had a strong feeling that this would subvert the entire athletic footwear industry "(Chinese shoes Network - the most authoritative and most professional shoe Information Center).Sports brand Nike days before and for its ultra popular shoes Flyknit Chukka brings the Mineral innovation Teal/Dark Obsidian-Hyper Jade-Copper color.
