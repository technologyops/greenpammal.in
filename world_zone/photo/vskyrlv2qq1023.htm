Puma's NRGY series, lau <a href="http://www.jordanscomingout.com/jordans-on-sale-mens.html"><strong>jordans on sale mens</strong></a> nched in 2014, is very angry because it uses a very similar foam cushioning technology like Adidas Boost, and this is my Adidas's home technology! Adidas brought the Puma to court, causing the NRGY series to stop selling. The day before, this time for 2 years the lawsuit was finally sentenced to Adidas, losing the outcome, so Puma can continue to research and development and sales of NRGY series. Feeling Adidas should be angry, ?



 in fact, Puma's foam mitigation technology also started with BASF's cooperative research and development at the very beginning, but later Adidas signed a sale contract with BASF, which led Puma to turn to  , Huntsman, Corp for follow-up research and development. 

 Puma now have not only the bradyseism patent is similar to the Boost, there are Flyknit, with woven fabrics like Primeknit, the next Sneaker ring will be what kind of change, for the majority of consumers, it is worth looking forward to!

Men's World Cup held in held in the 2016 Olympics. Adidas has recently been approved to become Brazil's World Cup official sponsors, but decided not to seek as the official sponsor of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. This is because the maximum strength is Adidas soccer, its CEO Herbert & middot; Hainer said, 'will focus all of our energy to run the World Cup.' Instead, Nike hopes to become an official Olympic sponsor its long and Brazil Olympic Committee signed a sponsorship agreement product ...... "
 These are the "Nihon Keizai Shimbun" Independent Olympic reporter at Tian Ying Ichiro, during the Olympic Games in London published a business report. As the "Nihon Keizai Shimbun" opened a synchronized Chinese news site, the news quickly spread throughout China size of the site, causing quite a stir. But today, Adidas did not quit, Ni <a href="http://www.jordanscomingout.com/jordan-3-katrina-2018.html" ><strong>jordan 3 katrina 2018</strong></a> ke just replace the International Olympic uniforms and equipment suppliers have 17 years of Japanese sports brand Mizuno - because, according to relevant regulations, Mizuno not take into account the International Olympic uniforms and equipment suppliers Tokyo 2020 Bid Committee sponsors, both can only choose one. After careful consideration Mizuno decided to support their bid. Nike official said the cooperation with the International Olympic Committee is the other side to throw an olive branch, and then hit it off. As to whether you want to replace an Olympic sponsor Adidas, Nike Brand President Charlie & middot; Denson signed with the IOC after the evasive response:. "We expect this will be a good start for our long-term, successful partnership." 
 Adidas high-level relations with the familiar German "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" senior sports reporter Michael & middot; Aspen Heim, in an interview made it clear that absolutely never heard Adidas leave a message ready to withdraw from the Olympics, "Although Adidas is difficult to compete in the US market through Nike, Nike has even sponsored by the German te <a href="http://www.jordanscomingout.com/air-jordan-11-space-jam-for-sale.html"><strong>air jordan 11 space jam for sale</strong></a> am played contention idea. But Adidas the official sponsor of the international competition firmly clutched in his hand, which means the World Cup, the European Cup, the Olympic Games and When the arrival of the UEFA Champions League and other events, Adidas will be able to sell a lot of products. I believe in the future for a long period of time, Adidas will not easily give up those tempting cake. "
 data also confirms the Aspen Anaheim point: after the London Olympics, Adidas announced first half 2012 sales in the UK rose by 24%, the UK Olympic licensed products sales increased 250 percent compared with the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, the relevant Product sales of over 100 million pounds. Unless it is a complete loss of confidence in the Brazilian market, otherwise it is not an official sponsor of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro reason resign. 
 Another possibility is that such rumors but Adidas play "cry of the child Naichi" trick. After all, during the London Olympic Games Organizing Committee put its biggest rival Nike on a horse, did not take the ban on Nike's "ambush marketing", but withdrew at the Lon <a href="http://www.alinktome.com/?p=450" title="Cheap jordans online air jordan 11 blackout for sale"><strong>Cheap jordans online air jordan 11 blackout for sale</strong></a> don launch of Nike ads and posters 9, this verdict Adidas unhappy . American investigators Toluna last July 16 to 18 for more than 1,000 US consumers online survey, up to 37% of respondents believe that Nike is the sponsor of the Olympic Games, while only 24% of respondents knew Adidas recognized officially. Brazilian soccer team and sponsor Nike for many years, Brazil basically be "home," Adidas "to retreat" is a move to put pressure on the IOC.

In Nike's endless creative sigh, and tinker Hatfield will air MAG smart ideas applied to shoes in the determination of production, we also wish to take this so far, a brief look at the intelligent technology in the history of the development of sports shoes of reincarnation. Micropaceradidaswas born in the 1984 Losangeles Olympic Games Micropacer Adidas is the first to join the smart elements of the SNEAKER products. Although the tongue is equipped with a simple pedometer, but in more than 30 years ago, this is absolutely a sufficiently in advance of the idea. After entering the 21st century, Adidas, more than once engraved this classic running shoes, and has joined such as Gore Tex waterproof material, undefeated stores and other joint series enough to let Micropacer to regain their youth a new gimmick. Is particularly worth mentioning is that recent Adidas will also Micropacer and two other Adidas retro running shoes of the classic elements to be refined and fusion, launched a new trend of running shoes, NMD. RS ComputerPumacompared to Micropacer, the birth of the late two years of RS Computer Puma actually a lot of mystery. This in a great extent is because RS computer too complicated "processors" is hard to like the simple pedometer Micropacer as the original engraved. Actually, puma will the heel huge electronic components simplified away, and keep the shoes that are unique to the 1980s retro appearance, in the name of RS100 engraved too this kind of running shoes. adidas_12005, Adidas launched very revolutionary smart shoes Adidas 1, the although there is a marvelous propaganda and high-tech products required expensive, but Adidas 1 use method is not complicated, as long as the switch is turned on, each run four step, the shoe body will automatically adjust to you the most suitable damping levels. This is because the heel of the magnetic sensor can feel the pressure of the pressure level and the size of this level of pressure will is transmitted to the intelligent shoe "brain" microprocessor. According to the size of the pressure level to determine the size of the shoe to determine the suitability of the shock, and then, the cable system will be driven by the motor to adjust the damping part of the shoe, so that the shoe needs to become more soft or hard. In the adidas_1 shortly after the launch, Adidas also Strike while the iron is hot. &#12297;<br><br><br>
