Adidas adiZero Rose 



 This pair of Adidas adiZero& Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; [Chinese shoes Network - brand observation] contention stores open woman Adidas, Nike gourd sell what medicine
 [sports stores in general, about seven or eight percent of consumers are men, women are often the types of products and styles only 30% to 35% of the total] 
 The most understand the Chinese market, it may not Chinese, but foreigners. 
 
 December 1, Adidas announced the end of December will open two stores in Chengdu, the woman, in October this year, Adidas has opened its first store in Beijing woman. 
 "eat crab" than Adidas. November 29, China's first, world's second woman to experience Nike store opening in Shanghai Central Trade iAPM. 
 woman opened stores, it looks fantastic, in fact, only those who will have such <a href="http://www.alinktome.com/?p=275"><strong>cheap foamposites</strong></a>  a wily shot. 
 women's needs are ignored 
 Over the past few years, the domestic sporting goods market was devastated, including the local brands, including Li Ning, one thousand more than the number of closed shop, product oversupply, high inventories, sporting goods company performance night returned a few years ago. 
 Market watchers Magang independent "First Financial Daily" reporters that excess Chinese sporting goods market, the truth is structural overcapacity, oversupply male sporting goods. Traditional stores in male and female same-store product displays, sports stores in general, there are about seven or eight percent of consumers are men, women are often the types of products and styles only 30% to 35% of the total. Male consumer demand largely been met, but a lot of women consumers demand is ignored. 
 neglected demand means that the market opportunity. Data from Frost & amp ;;;; Sullivan's show, in 2013 China sports products industry was a breakthrough 200 billion yuan, of which annual sales income women's products business in recent years have maintained double-digit growth <a href="http://www.jordanscomingout.com/jordan-retro-14-white-fuchsia-blast-black.html" ><strong>jordan retro 14 white/fuchsia blast/black</strong></a> , ahead of other various business segments. 
 Frost & amp ;;;; Sullivan global partner Wang Xin, Managing Director of China, and the reporter said: "In recent years, more and more Chinese women to join the ranks of sports and fitness, female consumer groups become China potential users of the sports goods market can not be ignored, women's sports products segment has shown a huge room for growth. With the growth of the overall sporting goods market in China stabilized, women's sports product segment has become an important sporting goods company's future One opportunity for development. "
 Adidas also confirmed that external analysts judge the Chinese women sporting goods market potential, in reply to a reporter's letter, Adidas, said: "Women category is one of our fastest-growing category, we have seen the great potential for growth. Since 2013 our women's product marketing activities, we have seen strong growth in sales of women's category, but also significantly increased the brand awareness of our target consumer groups. "
 is not selling product, is a social platform 
 local brands th <a href="http://www.jordanscomingout.com/jordans-on-sale-mens.html"><strong>jordans on sale mens</strong></a> e opportunity to the women's market is not entirely ignored. 3 to 4 years ago, Li Ning Company to Lin Chi-ling as the protagonist of "InnerShine" (listen to inner voice) advertising in Shanghai subway station often seen pushing the women's fitness products. 
 But how do retail, so that women can get in, retain, local brands may be multinational throw off a street away. 
 multinational woman out of the store, not just selling products, and is the place for women to socialize. Beijing Key Road Sports Consulting Ltd. founder Zhang said that multinational woman with multiple attribute stores, is to become a gathering place for women's sports enthusiasts and exchange places, eventually becoming the female consumer social platform, if the goal to reach the target consumer will establish a strong consumer stickiness. 
 Adidas replies the reporter said: "Chinese women to fitness and sports as a social activity, they enjoy with friends in class or go to the gym only that, they will usually exercise and sports into a major social networking. part of it. They may be together for coffee in yoga class, we might eat brunch together after fitness. Therefore, women consumers are looking for a fitness campaign that not only maximize performance but also worn in other social activities products and clothing. "
 Nike offers in Shanghai women experience store digital community service, in-store interactive digital screen provides counseling and New exclusive services, but also inquire into the monthly activity schedule, Nike + RunClub and Nike + TrainingClub course information, in-store elite Coach introduction and running routes nearby and recommend. 
 local brands can learn what 
 Similarly, Nike, Adidas thinking of Chinese bosses have, but not sporting goods circle. Lee Lang, CEO Liang-Star on the reporter said that clothing in the future should be a part of life, and the future of clothing, in addition to clothing, there should be coffee, ceramics, lamps, vases, all kinds of art, consumption who can take into the store to experience and enjoy the day, Lee Lang has plans to open this image model shop in the country. 
 original retail stores and can do as a social platform, which is almost deafening for local sports brands. Over the past few years, almost all of the local sports brand, "CCTV advertising + orders' wholesale business model, the same business model, similar products, the industry fell across the board. 
 Adidas has opened three stores are self-made woman Adidas, Zhang expressed this model can not be everywhere, local brands do not have the strength to follow. 
 independent woman store, requires stores must have a sufficient number of products and styles, Magang said one woman about 100 square meters store, should require about 100 models of products. Secondly, in the north of Guangzhou and other first-tier cities such, the creation of female store, taking into account the rent and other costs, to be sustainable, must be high efficiency Ping, Zhang, from the rate increase, the retail price of local brands is about cost about three times, but up to 6 times the multinational brands, multinational brand shop can bear higher costs, local brands may not be. 
 Zhang believes that local brands can be difficult to set up women's stores in first-tier cities, but the second and third tier cities and relatively low cost, you can try. 
 In addition, the local brands, for women's sports products and services to further refinement, easier and more feasible to change compared with the channel. Zhang said that, compared with men, women were generally mostly light running and other sports, materials for sporting goods, models have unique requirements. Nike Women experience the newly opened Shanghai store, the first of a special edition tights NikeTightoftheMomentxJordanSneakerTight, to the art of hand-drawn sketches way AirJordanVI processing, to meet the needs of female consumers. 
 female consumers are more likely to accept the new product concept, which sporting goods company, it is to root out the market opportunities. Wang Xin said, for example, women's wearable sports products, especially sports bust popularity wearable provides new ideas and directions for the development of women's sports goods market segments.
