An old cartoon animated cartoon "Pro Stars" is salute. The animation with MJ and two other sports stars as its prototype appeared on  . In 1991, Jordan Brand also built its corresponding color matching including  , Air Jordan 5, based on its theme.fool's day just past, you do not know whether it was from the tricky atmosphere came back. There are a few decent thing to talk today, in fact, originally intended to be on Saturday, is the last opening this new column, but the small problem is April 1st this day regular, seemed a bit not serious, so we moved today. 

 said the first thing first, and we opened a new column called " the editorial department's story " or, more accurately, " the story of the L7 editorial department ". Here, the editors of the L7 editorial department will write down essays, stories, or lists of wishes, no fixed content, and, to put it plainly, say what you want to say. At the same time, in this week's ", the editorial office, Day", we all send a present. 

 said something about the gift. It could be anything. For example, a pair of shoes, a sweater, a model of hand, or a handwritten text editor. In a word, you don't know what a gift is. We want to send you a " about Sneaker. ". 

 as for second things, that's one thing we've been promoting recently. As we all know, long7.com in the preceding days ushered in the new revision, visual experience, are stronger than the previous column classification is not a tiny bit. Well, in the recent, we furt <a href="http://www.jordanscomingout.com/air-jordan-11-space-jam-for-sale.html"><strong>air jordan 11 space jam for sale</strong></a> her improve the WeChat landing review function, access to the PC at the long7.com side, you can directly WeChat scan code landing, handy also code comments. 

 actually, what we're saying here is that we'd love to hear your voice. 

, whether it's our video column " extraordinary shoes; " or " ordinary shoes; " we all want to hear your voices. Sneakers are not a simple piece of art. Without communication, they don't seem to make culture and emotions communicate and influence each other. And say and do, is catching up with the classic " Vans; checkerboard " Slip On new offering, SOULGOODS also prepared a nice gift for you ~
, we'll pick a friend in the long.com review and send this new arrival of Slip On. 

 so, let's start with the first issue of the editorial department. 
 the past week has been a bit of a mess. The weather people's mood is sometimes hot and sometimes cold, will become inexplicable anxiety. When it comes to the products you want to pay, KAWS x, Air, Jordan, 4&#12297;Dee Brown in the 1991 all star game staged blindfolded dunk picture into a classic, and his feet the same classic boots Reebok Pump Omni Lite is about to return to the first year, the overall color to color, texture cortex of solid materials. It is reported that, Reebok Pump Omni Lite OG will be on February 17th, that is, the eve of the All-Star game officially released.I wonder if the Christmas match that just ended this morning has fulfilled your holiday appetite? The stars gave us t <a href="http://www.wedownjackets.com/jordans-on-sale/index.htm">jordans on sale online</a> he perfect gifts on the pitch with wonderful performances, but what will our superstars do after the intense game? The day before Nike Basketball will release a new "see you" wonderful video, let you know when there is no match in the super star is how to prepare for the. 
  
 the "see you" movie directed by Rick Famuyiwa, and Basketball by Nike and Wieden+Kennedy together to create the film in a unique way to dig Kobe Bryant, Elena Deller, Donne Anthony Davies, Kevin Durant, Paul George, Erwin Lebron and Kaili James 7 superstars life, seemingly humorous interpretation is their real life.
