      according to Indonesia, "Daily" reported on March 10th, although Chinese and the United States at the beginning of 2007 decline in economic growth, and the global stock market decline, but does not affect the Indonesia footwear products exported to the two countries.
        Indonesia Footwear Association (APRISINDO) chairman Addie (EddyWidjanarko) March 8th general told reporters in Jakarta: "so far, China's shoes exports to the United States not to encounter obstacles. If the economic situation in the United States worsens, our country will usually feel its effects 6 months later." 
        he admitted that he knew the U.S. economy is about to deteriorate; but so far, there has been no obstacle to the export of footwear products to the United states. 
        he said that the total number of shoes ordered from Europe, especially in Britain, declined. That's because the economic situation in Europe is not very good either. 
        he claimed that buyers from Britain began to look for errors in order to reduce the import of footwear from indonesia. Many shoe orders from Europe are now on hold. 
        a shoe factory in Surabaya has felt its impact. The total number of shoes they ordered has been reduced and the payment process has been delayed. 
        he claims: "they are making excuses for reducing the number of orders and delaying payments.". There are many reasons for it. For example, shoes are not sewn neatly." 
        he said in view of the United States worsening economic conditions impact exports to Indonesia, Indonesia shoes, because in Europe, Asia and Australia still has a l <a href="http://www.wedownjackets.com/buy-cheap-jordans-online/index.htm"><strong>buy cheap jordans online</strong></a> arge market, so Indonesia shoes will not be affected significantly. 
 :       he admitted that the total exports of Indonesian shoes to the United States accounted for 36% of total footwear exports in 2006 of $1 billion 600 million. Total exports of shoes to Indonesia in Europe were almost the same as that of footwear in 2006, or 1 billion 600 million of the $30%, while the remainder were exported to Malaysia, Singapore and australia. 
 :       Addie explained: "if the market in the United States worsens, our country still controls more than 60% of Europe, Asia and Australia.". But if the U.S. economy gets worse, shoes that are exported to China will be affected." 
        he said, "now there are 130 shoes to join Indonesian shoes" Emma CNC sponsored Chinese shoes design competition, to promote the original design of China's footwear industry to the world,  

      in mid June, Emma CNC Technology Co., China official with the arts and crafts import and Export Chamber of Commerce (CCCLA) signed a contract to become the 2009 "Chinese shoe design contest sponsors, Emma CNC technology has been committed to promoting the" Chinese shoes original design to the world ", the research and development of CAD/CAM system with leading footwear a digital industry, footwear industry preferred.

Li Ning, chief designer of Exeter Research bow technology company responsible Ned Frederick evaluated. Now, Ned has started Li Ning bow responsible for the development of second-generation technology.   As early as Li Ning bow when available, Ned once to designer friends with his former work at Nike's out of a small problem. The friend wanted to do research model, Ned answer is "Li Ning bow If you are interested, go to the store to buy it yourself." You know, Li Ning sports shoes bow was only sold in the Chinese market, and friends want to do research on this technology, may the Trustee will have special courier from China.   1970's, Nike introduced the first dual Tailwind running shoes Nike-Air shock absorbers equipped with advanced technology, from air-cushioned shoes began to become synonymous with high technology, known footwear revolution, but also achievements Nike's brilliant.   Li Ning, an important step for the company, is close to Nike have their own patents.   own patent   "real sports brands have their own patented technology cus <a href="http://www.jordanscomingout.com/jordans-on-sale-mens.html"><strong>jordans on sale mens</strong></a> hioning, Nike has thousands of patents." This is 2004, by the Chinese University of Hong Kong invited to lecture Ned talked about topic.   This allows a company manager in charge here, Li Ning Zhang Yan footwear products have a more bold idea, why not learn Nike, Adidas? January 2004, Li Ning Company from DuPont hired Zhang Yan, one of the most important job is on a global scale for the Li Ning Company to find excellent design resources.   2004, Li Ning, the company listed in Hong Kong this year, Li Ning Company has established a database of foot at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, this is the first sports brand to establish an oriental foot database. Nike, Adidas, while rich database of foot, but only in the West. "East-West foot is different, according to the oriental foot research and design of the shoes will be more suitable for Chinese people." Ned said.   apparently gave his speech, Li Ning's new inspiration. "The most important is sports shoes shock absorption, avoid sports injuries, we should have our own functional patented technology." The Board discussed this proposal after unanimous consent.   Li Ning is in a race with the Giants. In order to design more competitive running shoes, until 2005 Nike hired R & D personnel has exceeded 3,000 people. Many of them have a degree in biomechanics, experimental physiology, industrial design, chemistry and various related fields.   2004, Li Ning Company and Ned Exeter Research R & D company signed a contract over one million US dollars per year, Li Ning, the company has set up a project team. Ned who has worked several years for the Nike dev <a href="http://www.wedownjackets.com/jordans-on-sale/index.htm">jordans on sale online</a> elopment studio experts began working for the Li Ning, Li Ning develop their company's core technology.   "patents have been registered cushioning has more than 1200, to find a new breakthrough it is a difficult thing." Ned decided to go to China to look for inspiration. One day, Ned see the introduction Zhaozhou Bridge, arch designed to withstand forces, buffered water pressure, which was in line with sneakers bearing pressure relief requirements, but vaulted pressed down later, it is difficult to restore the prototype, you can not give sports by powerful response force.   It so happened that a friend invited Ned to experience an ancient sport ?? archery. With the strings of power, how to pull the bow can quickly restore the prototype. Ned shines, bow design shape.   This is followed by a long test. As a visiting professor at the University of Massachusetts Department of Sport, Ned the test election in the nation's most well-known University of Massachusetts sports body test chamber, where the most advanced testing equipment, including trajectory, stress testing, and so on. Nike, Adidas and other brands regarded here as a test base.   "Nike Air technology is to buffer the shock absorption by air pressure reaches, and even bow design with better protection movement. body when running, bow force will extend, with strings power, bow can quickly restore the prototype, increase jumping power. "Ned explained.   "a bow, cross bow or two, will bring different damping index for different sports can be applied to different sneakers." Ned thought, and Nike Air technology, Li Ning bow technique can also be <a href="http://www.alinktome.com/"><strong>Retro jordans for sale</strong></a>  extended to all types of products.     East meets West in the technology matures, Li Ning company needs is worthy heavily developed technology Li Ning bow design, shape design, use of materials, production processes are It should match. US DRD company served this task.   "The bronze pattern onto the upper How?" in Beijing Li Ning sports shoes design department, a designer is being discussed with companions. In the computer in front of him, has been storing a lot of the Great Wall, pottery, bronze and the like of image data. Which is full of oriental elements of information are organized into books and sent overseas design company Li Ning US DRD companies. Two designers who will collaborate to complete the final design.   Ned signed with developing its own patented technology, Li Ning, the company began looking for an overseas design team wants to bring the elements of oriental and international thinking together as one. Zhang Yan six-person team from the United States led the gathering designer in California, to the headquarters of Nike design splash Arslan, to Massachusetts, the six-person team were scored for each design firm, final consolidated elected is located in Massachusetts Dan (Dan ) DRD owned companies.   Dan was the Nike designers, the company's customers include well-known brands PUMA, the design team at the age of 30 up and down. Li Ning Company in accordance with the idea, after signing, DRD company began offering year-round total of 160 sports shoes design from 2005. DRD company should oriental elements to the design of sports shoes. Dan and his colleagues had to read a lot of t <a href="http://www.jordanscomingout.com/jordan-3-katrina-2018.html" ><strong>jordan 3 katrina 2018</strong></a> hings about China. Prior to this, Dan, just know that the Chinese theme of the film "Crouching Tiger."   For the Li Ning Company product managers and designers domestic companions good communication, Dan year round trips a 300,000 km of mileage, to the Great Wall, the Forbidden City looking oriental charm.   DRD Li Ning Company to meet international quality requirements, whether it is designs, materials, or manufacturing process, DRD companies are not inferior to Adidas, Nike. For example, high-end sports shoes are no longer using traditional rubber, adhesives, plastics and other toxic materials, but chose to advanced safety and health materials. DRD's design has been applied to all types of delegations and Li Ning sponsored star shoes, which have O'Neal on the court wearing basketball shoes.   September 2006, the first generation of sports shoes Li Ning bow listed as a trial, only running shoes series, its price up to 699 yuan. Since the integration of high-tech elements in product design, the first half of 2007, Li Ning footwear sales rose 44.5 percent from a year earlier. The October 2007 application listed Li Ning bow technology professional basketball shoes, in addition to the application of various technologies, "Zhong Kui" tongue snap on Facebook become the biggest embody oriental elements. These shoes have a full domineering name ?? "Zhong Kui", priced at 990 yuan, a record edition basketball shoes Li Ning listed price of a new high.   However, even with air cushion has comparable technology, Li Ning bow cushion can get that kind of success remains to be seen. Nike's sales in 1978 was $ 300 million, in 2005, Li Ning's sales is $ 300 million, Li Ning, the company seems to do everything in comparison with Nike.
