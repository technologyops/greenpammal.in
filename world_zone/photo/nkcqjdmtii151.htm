At the same time, in recent years, Taiwan enterprises have been closed down phenomenon. Some researchers pointed out that there is very few moments like this, so that Taiwanese businessmen in Dongguan so anxious, if not follow the pace of Dongguan and the mainland, take the initiative to upgrade the enterprise, transformation, it will inevitably be eliminated. In the face of its enormous survival crisis, Dongguan Taiwanese businessmen, who have always been considered to have "water and grass living" habits, are they going to abandon Dongguan completely, or do they actively carry out self-help to carry out the transformation layout? 
[phenomenon] Taiwan enterprises often shut down,
