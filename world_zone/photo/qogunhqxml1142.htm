 :     in the past few years, Taiwan has been able to look at Hongkong, South Korea and Singapore as the "Four Dragons of Asia" with an envious eye. Now, it is planning to recover the lost time. Yesterday, the Shanghai Taiwan Business Association Association President Zhang Fumei told reporters: "before the end of June, Taiwanese investment restrictions will be significantly relaxed." Zhang Fumei's other identity is Ma Ying-Jeou's backup team. Like him, many Taiwan companies have seen the westward expansion of the mainland as the only way out of the downturn.

When it comes to "5, 20", a Taiwan boss says the first thing to do is to formally  <a href="http://www.alinktome.com/?p=275"><strong>cheap foamposites</strong></a> introduce himself to old friends who have worked together for years. Prior to this, Taiwan enterprises to invest in China shall not exceed 40% of its net assets, and strictly limit sensitive technology exports.

      TSMC, which has set up a plant in Shanghai, Songjiang, is gradually increasing its investment in the mainland. Apart from investment restrictions, the relaxation of technical restrictions is equally important. "We expect further technical restrictions." TSMC spokesman Ceng Jinhao said.

Taiwan's chip industry is second to none in the world, but it lags far behind its rivals on the mainland. Equally vulnerable are flat panel displays and the petrochemical industry.
