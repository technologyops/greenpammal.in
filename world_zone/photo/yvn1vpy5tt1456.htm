  will affect more than 90% of the trade between China and Europe, resulting in a 0.4% decline in China's total chemical output value
In order to reduce the impact of 
, the national key areas of foreign trade were built to deal with R regulations of the laboratory


 
 
  which aims to maintain health and safety of residents within the EU regulations is a more stringent trade barriers than anti-dumping measures. Due to its complex procedures and wide range of coverage, the law has attracted worldwide attention.
 
 
 
  experts estimate that because of R, China and EU trade are affected, home textile and apparel, footwear, toys, light industry, electronics, automotive, pharmaceutical and other will be affected, the entire EU trade pattern and the pattern of downstream industries will face a major reshuffle. (editor in chief: admin)
The European Union's anti-dumping stick has targeted China's shoes severely.

 a obviously is the fact that if the EU footwear trade affected not only directly harm the interests of consumers and to the European Union, the European footwear equipment industry is also reduced because of the import Chinese shoes facing shrinking trade, the EU importers will greatly increase the cost of. Data show that if the European Union imposed 20% anti-dumping duties on shoes from Asia, then the shoes on the EU market will rise by 5%.
