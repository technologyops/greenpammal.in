 carefully looks at this shoe. The workmanship can be described as finely. The parts of the line, glue spill and hot-melt coating are all well controlled, which has made a good impression on the first contact with 361. At the same time, the weight of the shoes is not light, it is not a light quality product.   
 Strata uses three section of upper part is the seamless integration design, shoe uppers, multilayer breathable mesh and hot-melt support bars, toe additional reinforcement and protection design. The actual wear toe bending very freely, fasten shoelaces without foot feeling of oppression.   Support

The heel part of the slow shock is more obvious, running heel to the ground almost feel no obvious vibration, so this shoe is more suitable for back foot run method runner. And during a single more than ten kilometers of running, there is no obvious attenuation.   
 Strata but did not only take care of foot, forefoot design is worth affirming, by running can also experience the forefoot cushioning effect Qucikfoam. But with the Strata before and after the foot drop is not large, plus a stable running shoes bottom using large area stability control, always running a sole extra cost some strength.  &n;In the official website of KD VI <a href="http://www.alinktome.com/"><strong>Retro jordans for sale</strong></a> I LIFESTYLE is a new color, and there is no spy before the release of black leather uppers with translucent outsole Yazhen, supplemented by Logo and followed by red brown Griphook, leisure activity is slightly.

Adidas from Crazylight the first generation of began to be introduced this concept of the series, the light to the foot at the time triggered a wave. From the first generation of 9.8 ounces to the second generation 9.5 ounces, until now ADI master crazy light 3 9.3 ounces, to know, a pair of basketball shoes in as far as possible cut its own weight and provide necessary protection in order to adapt to the fierce competition is the most important, and as the odd only 263 grams of basketball shoes, ADI master crazy light 3 will bring you what kind of different feeling? Crazy Light adiZero 3 to our first feeling is light! If you use a comparison of words, it is true that the TMD light! Shoe model is like a super sports car is bound to be assertive appearance, the absolute speed concept is also reflected in the design of the entire pair of shoes. 3D SPRINTWEB vamp (lightweight lining + mesh cloth + functional material combination of three layers of hot-melt vamp) will light quantify this concept thoroughly in the end match breathable and beautiful design, can let you in running without any burden. tongue also uses the lighter material, although less common mesh tongue looks so good, but the permeability is quite awesome.  in the field, though it is also a continuation of the crazy light series of concentric outer shading road design, but can see and before have obvious differences, launched a new corrugated radiation is grasping the concept from the bottom of the extraterrestrial, in often part of the increased grain density. At the same time the corrugated lines relative to the circle is easier to get from all directions to enhance the friction grip performance. Good grip. after the ankle at the three bar environmental protection structure can provide ankle support, but the kind of bottom-up stable structure of combat effectiveness? In fact, due to the presence of the filling and three bars, the transition between the body and the waist of the shoe will be quite stiff, which led to the lack of stability of the shoe, hope to start this pair of shoes friends realize this point. finally, we come down to the shoe section of the slow shock performance, the use of the former low after the high end of the design. Tray SPRINTFRAME has from the heel extending to the bottom, the technology in the intention is to a certain intensity of material form a bowl shaped supporting structure to wrap to maintain the security and stability of the hind paw.
